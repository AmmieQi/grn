## Graph Recurrent Networks for Node Classifications

With the Cora dataset, we achieved around 83.7% average.

You can easily train the model by

**python train.py**


Hyperparameters are
* n_hids : 112
* n_iters: 9
* n_epochs: 200
* d1, d2 : 0.2 , d3: 0.4 (Dropout rates for RNN, Attention, Dense respectively)
* lr: 1e-2 (Learning rate)
* wd: 1e-2 (Weight decay)
* ps: 5 (Patience for early-stopping)
